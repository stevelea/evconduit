## Pricing Model

EVConduit operates on a **cost-recovery basis**, not for profit. The subscription fees are designed solely to cover:

1. **Third-party API costs** - Enode charges per-vehicle API access fees
2. **Infrastructure costs** - Server hosting, database (Supabase), monitoring (Sentry)
3. **Transactional services** - Email delivery (Brevo), payment processing (Stripe)

### Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Price | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Free | $0/month | Limited functionality, covers no external costs |
| Pro | ~$5-10/month | Full features, covers Enode API + infrastructure costs |

**Note:** Pricing is set at approximate break-even to cover operational expenses. There is no profit margin built into the pricing.

## Business Structure

- **Type:** Individual hobby project / side project
- **Legal Entity:** None - operated as an individual
- **Employees:** None - solo developer
- **Revenue Goal:** Cost recovery only, not profit-seeking
- **Transaction Volume:** Low volume, small user base

## Why Stripe?

Stripe is used to:
- Accept subscription payments from users who opt for the Pro tier
- Manage recurring billing

The expected transaction volume is low (hobby-scale), with small individual transactions.

## Summary

EVConduit is a personal hobby project providing a niche integration service for EV owners who use Home Assistant. It is not a commercial venture seeking profit - the sole purpose of accepting payments is to offset the real costs of operating the service (API fees, hosting, etc.). The developer operates this as a passion project for the smart home community.
