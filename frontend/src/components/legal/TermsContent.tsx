        This is a clone of the EVlinkHA project from Roger Asplen, it was his hobby project 
	but unfortunatley his website is offline and he is not answering emails or github at
	the moment, if in the future Roger resurfaces he may well want it back which i will
	have no issue with, but in the meantie hopefully this provides a substitute. Most of
        the code was well documented but some of the database stuff i have had to work out
	so all functions may not work as exected. Priority is to get the basic statistics
	for HA users.
	Use at your own risk.
